<b>VNC Extras, Add-ons and modifications</b></h2>

<!-- Ruler here? -->
<h3>
Firewalls</h3>
<i>Karl Harkimian &lt;</i><a href="mailto:hakimian@aha.com">hakimian@aha.com</a><i>>
sent in a patch to compile the Unix viewer so that it can reach external
servers through a SOCKS firewall.&nbsp; It's very simple, and the patch
is here: <a href="http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/contrib/socks-patch.txt">socks-patch.txt</a>.
These patches apply to 3.3.1 but they are simple enough to apply by hand
to later versions.</i>
<p><i>Obviously, you cannot access a server inside a firewall from outside
without specially configuring the firewall; that's what firewalls are for!
Christian A. Lademann <a href="mailto:cal@zls.de">cal@zls.de</a> has used
an elaborate scheme:</i>
<p>I have had a problem with connections from my workstation to a PC connected
to a customers LAN, because my firewall as well as the customers firewall
does IP-masquerading. This means that my workstation can only connect to
the customers firewall and the customers PC can only connect to my
<br>firewall. The reason for this is, of course, to hide the complete LAN
behind the firewall(s).
<p><i>Christian's solution involved a script listening on a single accessible
well-known port behind the firewall, which could accept incoming connections
and redirect them to the appropriate machine.&nbsp; His full details are
here: <a href="http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/contrib/rvnc.txt">rvnc.txt</a></i>

<h3>
SSLeay encryption</h3>
<i>Ray Jones <a href="mailto:rjones@pobox.com">rjones@pobox.com </a>has
built a version of VNC which uses SSLeay public key encryption for a more
secure connection.</i>
<p><i>You can get it from <a href="http://web.mit.edu/thouis/vnc">http://web.mit.edu/thouis/vnc</a>
.</i>

<h3>
Restricting connections by IP address (TCP wrapper)</h3>
<p><b>Note that similar functionality is now built in to the Windows VNC server.</b></p>

<p><i>Wolfram Gloger &lt;<a href="mailto:wmglo@dent.med.uni-muenchen.de">wmglo@dent.med.uni-muenchen.de</a>&gt;.</p>
writes:</i>
<p>In the list archives I notice there was a discussion of implementing
access control for Xvnc with the tcp wrapper library. I have now implemented
this for 3.3.2r2. You will need to have tcpd.h and libwrap already installed.
<p><i>Wolfram's full message is at <a href="http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/archives/1998-09/0168.html">http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/archives/1998-09/0168.html</a>
.</i>
<p><i>Jared Smolens &lt;<a href="mailto:jsmolens@andrew.cmu.edu">jsmolens@andrew.cmu.edu</a>>
has done an equivalent for WinVNC. He writes:</i>
<p>... I wrote some code to read a list of IPs to allow and IPs to deny
from a text file. The rules are identical (to the best of my knowledge)
to /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny on my Linux box and the text file's
syntax is close to that format. This is a feature which has been discussed
at least once on the mailing list, so I thought that you might want to
add it to the official code base.&nbsp;
<p>The x86 binaries and source code are available at:&nbsp;
<p><a href="ftp://wik.res.cmu.edu/pub/vncip_bin.zip">ftp://wik.res.cmu.edu/pub/vncip_bin.zip</a>
and <a href="ftp://wik.res.cmu.edu/pub/vncip_src.zip">ftp://wik.res.cmu.edu/pub/vncip_src.zip</a>
<p>I have two new files, ipauth.h and ipauth.cpp. I made some changes to
vncclient.cpp (but not the header) to use the class and disconnect unauthorized
clients. I also have a sample "iplist.txt" file which contains the allowed
IPs.&nbsp;
<p>The format of the text file works like this:
<p><tt>&lt;ALLOW|DENY> &lt;Partial/full IP></tt>
<br><tt>&lt;DENY ALL></tt>
<p>An unlimited, unordered list of IPs (or partial IPs) may be entered
into the file like this:
<p><tt>ALLOW 128.2.93.</tt>
<br><tt>ALLOW 128.2.87.80</tt>
<br><tt>DENY 128.220.</tt>
<br><tt>DENY ALL</tt>
<p>In this case, the DENY 128.220. is redundant because of the DENY ALL,
but you get the point. ALLOW ALL is the default, and if the user specifies
that, it is ignored. Allows always take precidence over denies. This code
is not case sensitive.&nbsp;
<p>I am fairly sure that I got rid of all of my memory leaks (I ran Purify
on it, but I have done some slight modifications since then). I also use
the fstream library. I don't know if you consider this to be too
<br>much overhead.&nbsp;

<h3>
zlib compression</h3>
<i>Dave DeBarr <a href="mailto:(debarr@mitre.org">(debarr@mitre.org</a>)
has modified the X server and viewer to use zlib-based compression.&nbsp;
We plan to incorporate something similar in the standard release before
long, but until then you can find his patches at:</i>
<p><a href="http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/archives/1998-08/0039.html">http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/archives/1998-08/0039.html</a>
<p><i>In addition, Dave has provided patches for the Windows viewer at:</i>
<p><a href="http://www.uk.research.att.com:80/vnc/archives/1998-08/0228.html">http://www.uk.research.att.com:80/vnc/archives/1998-08/0228.html</a>
<p><i>Luis B. Almeida has also created a version of the Windows software
which you can get from </i><a href="ftp://neural.inesc.pt/pub/lba/vnc">ftp://neural.inesc.pt/pub/lba/vnc</a>
.

<p><i>Warren Toomey has done an alternative implementation of zlib compression,
along with some other hacks, which you can get from:</i>
<p><a href="http://minnie.cs.adfa.edu.au/VNC_bits/">http://minnie.cs.adfa.edu.au/VNC_bits/</a>

<h3>
x2vnc</h3>
<i>Here's a different twist to VNC. Fredrik Hubinette <a href="mailto:hubbe@hubbe.net">hubbe@hubbe.net</a>
has written a VNC-based variation on the popular x2x program.&nbsp; If
you run x2vnc on an X server, you can move off the side of the screen and
the mouse movements will then be sent to a VNC server (eg. a PC sitting
beside it) He writes:</i>
<p>x2vnc is basically a stripped down version of the vncviewer but with
slightly different goals and a very different GUI.. :)
<p>x2vnc emulates a 'dual head' setup by catching when the user tries to
move the pointer past the edge of the screen. This allows me to control
<br>both computers from one mouse/keyboard.
<p>I have made x2vnc available for download from my web site:
<p><a href="http://www.hubbe.net/~hubbe/x2vnc.html">http://www.hubbe.net/~hubbe/x2vnc.html</a>

<h3>
Enhanced Java viewer for JDK 1.1</h3>
Muddassar Farooq &lt;mfarooq@cse.unsw.edu.au> has produced an enhanced
version of the Java VNC viewer.
<p>When run as a standalone application, it adds scrollbars, and the ability
to specify 'host:display' as with the other VNC viewers.
<p>It uses the Java 1.1 event model, so is 'better' Java, but won't run
on older JVMs &amp; browsers.
<p>You can get it from <a href="http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/contrib/mfviewer.tar.gz">http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/contrib/mfviewer.tar.gz
</a>.

<h3>
VncMonitor</h3>
<i>John Wilson &lt;<a href="mailto:tug@wilson.co.uk">tug@wilson.co.uk</a>> writes:</i>
<p>VncMonitor is intended for those people who need to monitor several
remote systems. A single window is used to present all the displays. The
tab or backtab key allows the user to switch between systems. The return
key causes the currently viewed system display to be transferred to its
own window and the user can interact with the system using the mouse and
keyboard. Closing
<br>the new window returns the monitored system display back to the initial
window.
<p>The configuration of VncMonitor is controlled by a file which contains
all the information about what systems are to be monitored.
<p>A version can be downloaded from:
<p><a href="http://www.wilson.co.uk/Software/vnc/VncMonitor.htm">http://www.wilson.co.uk/Software/vnc/VncMonitor.htm</a>

<h3>VNCProxy</H3>

<p>John Wilson has also written VNCProxy, a Java proxy that can sit
between a VNC viewer and server and can be configured to map various
incoming requests to different VNC servers. You can find it at <A
HREF="http://www.wilson.co.uk/Software/vnc/proxy/VncProxy.htm">http://www.wilson.co.uk/Software/vnc/proxy/VncProxy.htm</A></p>

<h3>VNConnector</h3>

<p>Alastair Burr has written a similar program to allow you to switch between multiple VNC servers. VNConnector can be found <a href="http://www.chronetal.vispa.co.uk/m_programs.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3>VNCScan</h3>

<p><A HREF="mailto:steveb@tshore.com">Steve Bostedor</A> has written a
utility which will scan a network and list the machines running VNC
servers. You can find it at <A
HREF="http://tgcs.d-a-v-e.com/vncscan/vshome.htm">http://tgcs.d-a-v-e.com/vncscan/vshome.htm</A>. You'll
need to email Steve for the password to unzip the file.</p> <p>(You
can also use port scanners such as <a
href="http://www.insecure.org/nmap">nmap</a> or <a
href="http://avian.org/web1/hak/netcat.html">Netcat</a> to scan for
the ports used by VNC. See the <a href="faq.html">VNC FAQ</a> for
details of these ports.)</p>

<h3>iXvnc</h3>
<p>
Andre Moreira <A HREF="mailto:andre@dei.isep.ipp.pt">&lt;andre@dei.isep.ipp.pt&gt;</A> has written some patches for Xvnc to allow it to be run under the control of inetd and hence be started automatically as users connect.
See <A HREF="http://www.dei.isep.ipp.pt/~andre/extern/ixvnc.htm">http://www.dei.isep.ipp.pt/~andre/extern/ixvnc.htm</A> for details.
</p>

<h3>Share a Single Window</h3>
<p>
Céline FAGES <A HREF="mailto:celine.fages@silogic.fr">&lt;celine.fages@silogic.fr&gt;</A> has written some modifications for WinVNC to allow it to share a single window.<p>
See <A HREF="http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/contrib/one-window.txt">http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/contrib/one-window.txt</A> for the modification details.<p>
See Céline's original message in: <A HREF="http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/archives/2000-02/0658.html">http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/archives/2000-02/0658.html</A>
