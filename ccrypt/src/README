   Secure encryption and decryption of files and streams
     _________________________________________________________________

  Updated January 29, 2002

  Description

   ccrypt is a utility for encrypting and decrypting files and streams.
   It was designed to replace the standard unix crypt utility, which is
   notorious for using a very weak encryption algorithm. ccrypt is based
   on the Rijndael cipher, which is the U.S.  government's chosen
   candidate for the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES, see
   http://www.nist.gov/aes/).  This cipher is believed to provide very
   strong security.

   Unlike unix crypt, the algorithm provided by ccrypt is not symmetric,
   i.e., one must specify whether to encrypt or decrypt. The most common
   way to invoke ccrypt is via the commands ccencrypt and ccdecrypt.
   There is also a ccat command for decrypting a file directly to the
   terminal, thus reducing the likelihood of leaving temporary plaintext
   files around.  In addition, there is a compatibility mode for
   decrypting legacy unix crypt files. An emacs mode is also supplied for
   editing encrypted text files.

   Encryption and decryption depends on a keyword (or key phrase)
   supplied by the user.  By default, the user is prompted to enter a
   keyword from the terminal.  Keywords can consist of any number of
   characters, and all characters are significant (although ccrypt
   internally hashes the key to 256 bits). Longer keywords provide better
   security than short ones, since they are less likely to be discovered
   by exhaustive search.

   For a detailed description of the encryption algorithm used by ccrypt,
   see the man page.

  News

   For a detailed list of changes, see the ChangeLog.

   January 29, 2002: Release 1.2. This release provides vastly improved
   encryption/decryption speed. By optimizing one critical inner loop,
   ccrypt now runs about 2-3 times faster than the previous release. The
   only other changes were some minor improvements to the autoconf
   scripts. No new features were added.

   November 28, 2001: Release 1.1. There are two major changes in this
   release: first, I have added an option --unixcrypt, which allows the
   decryption of files that have been encrypted with the old unix "crypt"
   utility.  Since the cipher used by "crypt" is broken and no longer
   secure, it is recommended that all such files should be converted to
   the ccrypt format. The second change is that ccrypt is now configured
   using the automake/autoconf tools. This should make compilation and
   installation a lot more standard and portable. This release of ccrypt
   compiles under Linux, SunOS, MacOS X, FreeBSD, AIX, and CygWin with no
   problems, and it should be portable to other systems with no or few
   changes.  I have also added some tests that can be invoked by "make
   check", which check that ccrypt is working properly.

   October 30, 2001: Release 1.0. This is the first public release of
   ccrypt.  It fixes the file format and the basic user interface. All
   future releases of ccrypt will be backward compatible with this
   format, i.e., they will be able to decrypt files that were produced by
   earlier releases.

  Downloading and Installing

   The current version of ccrypt can be downloaded as a gzipped tar
   archive from http://ccrypt.sourceforge.net/. You can unpack the
   archive with a command such as

       tar -zxf ccrypt-XXX.tar.gz

   For compiling and installation, please follow the instructions in
   the file INSTALL.

   ccrypt is also available in precompiled formats for a number of
   popular platforms, including Linux, MacOS X, FreeBSD, Sun Solaris,
   AIX, and Windows under CygWin.  In each case, just install the
   binaries in one of the places where the operating system usually
   looks for them, such as /usr/local/bin. You should also create
   symbolic links to the ccrypt binary named ccencrypt, ccdecrypt, and
   ccat; when ccrypt is invoked by one of these names, its default
   behavior changes. To create the appropriate links, change to the
   directory where you have installed ccrypt, and run the commands

       ln -s ccrypt ccencrypt 
       ln -s ccrypt ccdecrypt 
       ln -s ccrypt ccat

   You may also want to install the man page by copying ccrypt.1 to an
   appropriate directory, such as /usr/local/man/man1.

   Windows users see the file README.win.

   For users of the Redhat Package Manager, ccrypt is also available
   as a source RPM or binary RPM.

  Emacs support

   ccrypt comes with an emacs package for reading and writing encrypted
   files. The package is called jka-compr-ccrypt, and it is based
   directly on the jka-compr package which is part of GNU Emacs. It
   handles both encrypted and compressed files (although currently not
   encrypted compressed files).

   To use the package, simply load jka-compr-ccrypt and edit as usual.
   When you open a file with the ".cpt" extension, emacs will prompt you
   for a password for the file. It will remember the password for the
   buffer, and when you save the file later, it will be automatically
   encrypted again (provided you save it with a ".cpt" extension). Except
   for the password prompt, the operation of the package should be
   transparent to the user. The package also handles compressed ".gz",
   ".bz2", and ".Z" files, and it should be used instead of, not in
   addition to, jka-compr. The command M-x ccrypt-set-buffer-password can
   be used to change the current password of a buffer.

   The simplest way to use this package is to include the lines

       (setq load-path (cons "path" load-path))
       (require 'jka-compr-ccrypt "jka-compr-ccrypt.el")

   in your .emacs file, where path is the directory which holds the file
   jka-compr-ccrypt.el.
