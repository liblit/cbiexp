<!-- "predictor-info" is an ordered collection of predicates believed to be candidate failure predictors.  The order here is the same as the order in "preds.txt".  In ranked predictor lists that include index="nnn" attributes, the index number refers to the order of the "info" children under this element.  In accordance with general XPath conventions, those children are numbered starting from 1, not 0. -->

<!-- "info" gives detailed information about a single candidate failure predictor.  This includes most of the static site information originally found on a single line of some ".sites" file.  This also includes some statistical information derived from the statistical debugging analysis.  Thus, this element contains both static and dynamic data. -->
